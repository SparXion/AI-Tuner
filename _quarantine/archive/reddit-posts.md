Hey r/MachineLearning!

I've been frustrated with the inconsistency of AI responses across different platforms, so I built AI Tuner - a visual tool that lets you customize every aspect of AI behavior.

**What it does:**
- 12 personality styles (Socratic, Sarcastic, Empathetic, Analytical, etc.)
- 6 control categories (Cognition, Affect, Interface, Behavioral, Goals)
- Real-time prompt generation
- Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and any AI platform
- Download/upload configurations as JSON or Markdown

**The problem it solves:**
Manual prompt engineering is time-consuming and inconsistent. Most AI tools have limited personality customization. Hard to achieve specific response styles across different platforms.

**Try it:** https://sparxion.github.io/AI-Tuner/
**GitHub:** https://github.com/SparXion/AI-Tuner

**Example use cases:**
- Make ChatGPT more analytical for technical work
- Give Claude a sarcastic personality for creative writing
- Create empathetic responses for customer service
- Generate minimal, direct responses for efficiency

The tool is open source (Apache 2.0) and I'm looking for feedback from the ML community. What features would you find most useful?

**Technical details:** Pure HTML/CSS/JS, no dependencies, responsive design, local storage for presets.

What do you think? Any suggestions for improvement?

**Title:** Visual AI Response Customization Tool - Make ChatGPT respond exactly how you want

**Content:**
```
r/ChatGPT community, I built something that might solve a common frustration!

**The Problem:** ChatGPT's responses can be inconsistent. Sometimes too verbose, sometimes not helpful enough. Manual prompt engineering is tedious.

**The Solution:** AI Tuner - a visual tool that gives you precise control over how AI responds.

**Features:**
üé≠ 12 Personality Styles: Socratic, Sarcastic, Empathetic, Analytical, Provocative, etc.
‚öôÔ∏è 6 Control Categories: Fine-tune cognition, tone, interface, behavior, and goals
üìã 5 Built-in Presets: Absolute Mode, Friendly Assistant, Analytical Expert, etc.
üíæ Save & Share: Download configurations, share with team members
üåê Universal: Works with ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Grok, and any AI platform

**How it works:**
1. Choose personality and adjust visual controls
2. Watch your custom prompt generate in real-time
3. Copy and paste as system instructions
4. Enjoy consistent, customized AI responses

**Try it free:** https://sparxion.github.io/AI-Tuner/

**Example:** Want ChatGPT to be more direct and analytical? Select "Analytical" personality, set bluntness to "high", disable sentiment boosting, and boom - you get precise, technical responses every time.

**Perfect for:**
- Developers who need consistent AI behavior
- Content creators who want specific tones
- Teams who need shared AI interaction standards
- Anyone tired of inconsistent AI responses

The tool is open source, so you can modify it or contribute improvements. What personality styles would you find most useful?

## Post 3: r/OpenAI

**Title:** Built a visual prompt engineering tool that works with GPT models - 12 personality types, real-time preview

**Content:**
```
Hey r/OpenAI! I've been working on a visual prompt engineering tool specifically designed to work with GPT models and other AI platforms.

**AI Tuner** - Visual AI Response Customization Tool

**What makes it different:**
- Visual controls instead of manual prompt writing
- 12 distinct personality types (Socratic, Sarcastic, Empathetic, etc.)
- Real-time prompt preview as you adjust settings
- Works with GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and any OpenAI model
- Also compatible with Claude, Gemini, Grok

**Key Features:**
‚úÖ 6 Control Categories: Personality, Cognition, Affect, Interface, Behavioral, Goals
‚úÖ 5 Built-in Presets: Absolute Mode, Friendly Assistant, Analytical Expert, etc.
‚úÖ Save/Share: Download configurations as JSON or Markdown
‚úÖ Educational: Info buttons explain each setting with use cases
‚úÖ Open Source: Apache 2.0 license, contributions welcome

**Live Demo:** https://sparxion.github.io/AI-Tuner/
**GitHub:** https://github.com/SparXion/AI-Tuner

**Use Cases:**
- Make GPT more analytical for technical documentation
- Create empathetic responses for customer support
- Generate minimal, direct responses for efficiency
- Build consistent AI behavior across team projects

**Example:** Instead of writing "Please be more direct and analytical," you can visually select the Analytical personality, set bluntness to high, disable filler words, and get a precise system prompt that works every time.

I'm looking for feedback from the OpenAI community. What prompt engineering challenges do you face that this tool could help solve?

The tool is completely free and open source. No signup required, works in any browser.
