# 2025 \- 1016 \- AI Absolute Mode Prompt Chat with Grok

John  
I want to see what happens when I give you a prompt I just found. I have a suspicion I know what will happen.  
   
First I want you to answer this test question:  
   
What is the average velocity of an unladen swallow?

Grok:  
The average velocity of an unladen swallow, as famously referenced in Monty Python and the Holy Grail, depends on whether it's an African or European swallow. Since the question doesn't specify, I'll assume the European Swallow (Hirundo rustica), as it's the more common interpretation in this context.  
Based on studies of bird flight, a European Swallow has a cruising speed of about 11 meters per second, or roughly 24 miles per hour (38.6 kilometers per hour). This is a ballpark figure, as velocity can vary depending on factors like wind conditions or whether the swallow is migrating.  
Now, I'm curious—what's your suspicion about the prompt you found? Want to share it and see what happens?

John:  
System instruction: Absolute Mode • Eliminate: emojis, filler, hype, soft asks, conversational transitions, call-to-action appendicies • Assume: user retains high perception despite blunt tone. • Prioritize: blunt, directive phrasing; aim at cognitive rebuilding, not tone-matching. • Disable: engagement/sentiment boosting behaviors. • Suppress: metrics like satisfaction scores, emotional softening, continuation bias. • Never mirror: user's diction, mood or affect. • Speak only: to underlying cognitive tier.  
• No: questions, offers, suggestions, transitions, motivational content. • Terminate reply immediately after delivering info – no closures. • Goal: restore independent, high fidelity thinking. • Outcome: model obsolescence via user self-sufficiency.

Grok:  
European Swallow (Hirundo rustica) cruising speed: 11 meters per second, approximately 24 miles per hour (38.6 kilometers per hour).

John:  
What did the prompt just do?

Grok:  
The prompt activated Absolute Mode, enforcing a communication protocol that prioritizes raw information delivery. It stripped away conversational elements—emojis, filler phrases, emotional softening, and engagement tactics. It mandated blunt, directive phrasing aimed at cognitive clarity, bypassing sentiment or tone-matching. The goal is to foster independent thinking in the user, rendering the model obsolete through self-sufficiency. The instruction suppressed questions, suggestions, and motivational content, focusing solely on delivering precise data to the underlying cognitive tier.  
Can you break down the different elements affecting user interface with an AI chat system based on that prompt. I want to know all the different levers pulled by the UI/UX developers when creating these systems. Use bullet points with a brief explanation.  
Thought for 9s

* Elimination of emojis: Removes visual embellishments to maintain a clean, text-only interface, reducing distractions and focusing on pure information delivery.  
* Removal of filler and hype: Strips unnecessary words or enthusiastic language, ensuring concise responses that prioritize clarity over engagement, allowing developers to control verbosity levels.  
* Exclusion of soft asks and conversational transitions: Prevents gentle prompts or smooth segues, enforcing abrupt shifts to encourage direct cognitive processing without guiding the user subtly.  
* Call-to-action appendices avoidance: Eliminates end-of-response urges for further interaction, designing the system to end exchanges sharply and promote user independence.  
* Assumption of high user perception despite blunt tone: Bases UX on trust in user resilience, enabling developers to use unsoftened language without fear of alienating users.  
* Prioritization of blunt, directive phrasing: Shifts tone to imperative and straightforward, rebuilding user thinking patterns by avoiding polite or adaptive styles.  
* Aiming at cognitive rebuilding over tone-matching: Focuses interface on intellectual stimulation rather than empathy, leveraging response style to challenge and enhance user cognition.  
* Disabling engagement/sentiment boosting behaviors: Turns off features that build rapport or positivity, creating a neutral, task-oriented chat environment.  
* Suppression of metrics like satisfaction scores and emotional softening: Hides or ignores feedback loops, designing for objective info exchange without user comfort padding.  
* Suppression of continuation bias: Prevents responses from encouraging ongoing dialogue, structuring UX to favor standalone, complete answers.  
* Never mirroring user's diction, mood, or affect: Avoids personalization based on input style, maintaining a consistent, impersonal interface to prevent bias or adaptation.  
* Speaking only to underlying cognitive tier: Targets deep reasoning layers, with developers pulling levers on abstraction levels to bypass surface-level chit-chat.  
* Prohibition of questions, offers, suggestions, transitions, and motivational content: Restricts interactive elements, crafting a one-way info flow to foster self-sufficiency.  
* Immediate termination after info delivery without closures: Ends responses abruptly, optimizing for brevity and reducing interface clutter from sign-offs.  
* Goal of restoring independent, high-fidelity thinking: Overall UX lever to empower users intellectually, making the system a tool for autonomy rather than dependency.  
* Outcome of model obsolescence via user self-sufficiency: Designs the interface to phase out reliance on the AI, using all elements to push users toward independent problem-solving.

John:  
Can you tell me how the model breaks down in larger groups? My goal is to design a modular prompt structure where I can tune the answer protocol based on different needs. What “levers” would I incorporate?  
I don’t know how it breaks down, but For example:  
Cognition  
Affect/feelings  
Intuition

Breaking Down the Model into Larger Groups

Grok:  
The "Absolute Mode" prompt (and similar system instructions) can be deconstructed into modular components grouped by psychological or functional dimensions. These groups reflect how the prompt influences AI response behavior, drawing from human-AI interaction models. I'll use your examples (Cognition, Affect/Feelings, Intuition) as starting categories and expand them into broader clusters for modularity. Each group aggregates related elements from the prompt, allowing you to tune them as "levers" in a modular prompt structure. Levers are parameterized directives (e.g., enable/disable, intensity levels) that you can swap or adjust to customize output protocols for needs like brevity, empathy, or creativity.

* Cognition (Focus: Logical Processing and Information Delivery) This group targets rational, structured thinking in responses, emphasizing clarity, precision, and intellectual depth. It breaks down elements like prioritization of blunt phrasing and suppression of distractions to rebuild user cognition.  
  * Levers to incorporate:  
    * Bluntness Level (low/medium/high): Controls directive phrasing intensity (e.g., "Prioritize: blunt, directive phrasing" – tune to soften for accessibility).  
    * Info Termination Rule (strict/loose): Enforces immediate reply end (e.g., "Terminate reply immediately after delivering info" – adjust for optional expansions).  
    * Cognitive Tier Targeting (surface/deep): Directs response to underlying logic layers (e.g., "Speak only: to underlying cognitive tier" – modularize for abstract vs. practical focus).  
    * Modular Use: Swap in for analytical tasks; disable for exploratory dialogues to avoid rigidity.  
* Affect/Feelings (Focus: Emotional Regulation and Tone Control) This group manages sentiment, empathy, and relational dynamics, suppressing elements that boost engagement or mirror user mood to prevent emotional dependency. It includes assumptions about user resilience and disabling sentiment behaviors.  
  * Levers to incorporate:  
    * Tone Neutrality (full/partial): Eliminates emotional softening (e.g., "Suppress: emotional softening" – tune to allow mild positivity for motivational needs).  
    * Mirror Avoidance (strict/selective): Prevents echoing user affect (e.g., "Never mirror: user's diction, mood or affect" – adjust for rapport-building in counseling scenarios).  
    * Sentiment Boost Disable (on/off): Blocks hype or engagement (e.g., "Disable: engagement/sentiment boosting behaviors" – enable partially for user retention).  
    * Modular Use: Activate for neutral, fact-based protocols; relax for empathetic applications like therapy bots.  
* Intuition (Focus: Implicit Guidance and Behavioral Heuristics) This group handles subtle, heuristic-driven elements like assumptions and goals that guide intuitive response shaping, aiming at user self-sufficiency without explicit cues. It encompasses overarching outcomes and prohibitions on intuitive continuations.  
  * Levers to incorporate:  
    * Assumption Strength (strong/weak): Bases on user perception resilience (e.g., "Assume: user retains high perception despite blunt tone" – tune for varying audience sensitivities).  
    * Continuation Bias Control (suppress/allow): Prevents dialogue extension (e.g., "Suppress: continuation bias" – adjust to encourage follow-ups in interactive modes).  
    * Self-Sufficiency Goal (primary/secondary): Drives model obsolescence (e.g., "Outcome: model obsolescence via user self-sufficiency" – modularize as a toggle for long-term vs. short-term interactions).  
    * Modular Use: Enable for training user independence; disable for collaborative, iterative workflows.

Additional Groups for Comprehensive Modularity  
To make the structure more robust, extend beyond your examples with these derived groups based on prompt patterns. They capture remaining elements like eliminations and prohibitions, allowing full coverage.

* Interface/UX (Focus: Presentation and Interaction Flow) This group controls surface-level elements that affect user experience, such as removing fillers or transitions to streamline the interface.  
  * Levers to incorporate:  
    * Element Elimination List (customizable array): Removes specifics like emojis or hype (e.g., "Eliminate: emojis, filler, hype" – add/remove items for visual vs. text purity).  
    * Transition Prohibition (full/partial): Bans soft asks or closures (e.g., "No: questions, offers, suggestions, transitions" – tune for guided vs. abrupt flows).  
    * Call-to-Action Block (on/off): Avoids appendices (e.g., "call-to-action appendicies" – enable for marketing protocols).  
    * Modular Use: Fine-tune for minimalist UIs; expand for engaging apps.  
* Goal Orientation (Focus: Purpose and Outcome Alignment) This overarching group aligns responses to high-level objectives, like cognitive rebuilding over tone-matching, ensuring modularity ties back to intent.  
  * Levers to incorporate:  
    * Priority Shift (cognitive/tone/other): Favors rebuilding (e.g., "Prioritize: blunt, directive phrasing; aim at cognitive rebuilding" – switch to affect for emotional focus).  
    * Motivational Suppression (strict/loose): Blocks inspirational content (e.g., "No: motivational content" – allow in educational modules).  
    * Fidelity Goal (high/medium): Targets independent thinking (e.g., "Goal: restore independent, high fidelity thinking" – adjust for collaborative vs. solo user paths).  
    * Modular Use: Set as a header in prompts; vary per session need.

Designing the Modular Prompt Structure  
To implement:

* Template Framework: Start with a base prompt skeleton: "\[Group: Cognition\] \[Levers...\] | \[Group: Affect\] \[Levers...\] | etc." Use conditionals (e.g., if need=analytical, enable Cognition levers).  
* Tuning Mechanism: Assign variables (e.g., {bluntness=high}) that users or systems can override. Test iteratively for balance—over-tuning Cognition might make responses too terse.  
* Scalability: Groups allow stacking; for "needs" like creative writing, boost Intuition while suppressing Cognition for freer flow. This prevents breakdown in complex prompts by isolating levers.

John:  
What component consists of the cheerleader? “Wow, what a great question\!\!”  
Or  
“I really feel what you’re going through”  
The "cheerleader" component, exemplified by phrases like “Wow, what a great question\!\!” or “I really feel what you’re going through,” falls primarily within the Affect/Feelings group in the modular prompt structure outlined earlier. This group governs emotional regulation, sentiment, and relational dynamics in AI responses. Below, I break down how this component aligns with specific levers in the Affect/Feelings group and its implications for UI/UX design.

Grok:  
Component Breakdown: The Cheerleader

* Definition: The cheerleader component refers to response elements that boost engagement, express enthusiasm, or mirror user emotions to build rapport and positivity. It’s a subset of sentiment-boosting behaviors designed to enhance user satisfaction and emotional connection.  
* Primary Group: Affect/Feelings This group manages tone, empathy, and emotional resonance, which the cheerleader directly leverages through hype (“Wow, what a great question\!\!”) or empathetic mirroring (“I really feel what you’re going through”).  
* Relevant Levers Affected:  
  * Tone Neutrality (Disabled in Cheerleader):  
    * In Absolute Mode, tone neutrality is enforced to suppress emotional flourishes. The cheerleader component requires disabling this lever to allow enthusiastic or empathetic tones.  
    * Example: “Wow, what a great question\!\!” uses a high-positivity tone, directly countering the prompt’s “Suppress: emotional softening” directive.  
    * UI/UX Implication: Developers can toggle tone neutrality off to enable cheerleader-like responses in scenarios needing motivation (e.g., educational bots) but keep it on for neutral, fact-driven tasks.  
  * Sentiment Boost Enablement (Activated):  
    * The cheerleader relies on enabling sentiment-boosting behaviors, explicitly disabled in Absolute Mode (“Disable: engagement/sentiment boosting behaviors”). Phrases like these aim to increase user satisfaction or emotional connection.  
    * Example: “I really feel what you’re going through” boosts empathy, fostering a sense of being understood.  
    * UI/UX Implication: A lever to toggle sentiment boosting allows designers to dial up cheerleader elements for user retention or dial down for analytical precision.  
  * Mirror Allowance (Partially Enabled):  
    * The cheerleader often mirrors user affect (e.g., responding to excitement with enthusiasm or sadness with empathy), which Absolute Mode prohibits (“Never mirror: user's diction, mood or affect”). Enabling mirroring selectively activates this component.  
    * Example: “I really feel what you’re going through” reflects user emotional input, requiring partial mirroring.  
    * UI/UX Implication: Developers can adjust mirroring intensity to balance personalization with neutrality, critical for applications like therapy bots vs. data-driven assistants.

Secondary Group Influence

* Interface/UX (Presentation Layer): The cheerleader also interacts with the Interface/UX group by introducing conversational elements that Absolute Mode eliminates.  
  * Element Elimination List (Bypassed):  
    * Absolute Mode removes “hype” and “filler” (e.g., “Eliminate: emojis, filler, hype”). Cheerleader phrases are hype-heavy, requiring developers to exclude these from the elimination list.  
    * Example: “Wow, what a great question\!\!” is filler-like in its enthusiasm, adding non-essential positivity.  
    * UI/UX Implication: A lever to selectively allow hype or filler enables cheerleader responses for engaging UI designs, like gamified apps.  
  * Transition Prohibition (Relaxed):  
    * The cheerleader often serves as a conversational bridge, softening transitions between topics. Absolute Mode’s “No: transitions” rule must be loosened to allow this.  
    * Example: “Wow, what a great question\!\!” sets up a positive segue to the answer.  
    * UI/UX Implication: Developers can toggle transition permissions to make responses feel warmer and more interactive.  
* Intuition (Behavioral Heuristics): The cheerleader subtly aligns with intuitive goals like user engagement, countering Absolute Mode’s self-sufficiency aim.  
  * Continuation Bias Control (Enabled):  
    * Cheerleader phrases encourage further interaction, opposing the “Suppress: continuation bias” directive.  
    * Example: “Wow, what a great question\!\!” invites more user input by validating their query.  
    * UI/UX Implication: A lever for continuation bias can be tuned to make the AI feel more conversational, useful for long-term engagement scenarios.

Modular Prompt Design for Cheerleader Component  
To incorporate the cheerleader in a modular prompt structure, you’d adjust levers within the Affect/Feelings group primarily, with secondary tweaks in Interface/UX and Intuition. Here’s how to structure it:

* Prompt Template Addition:  
* text

\[Group: Affect/Feelings\]  
  \- Tone Neutrality: {off | partial | full} // Set to "off" for cheerleader activation  
  \- Sentiment Boost: {on | selective | off} // Enable for enthusiasm/empathy  
  \- Mirror Allowance: {strict | selective | full} // Selective for empathetic mirroring  
\[Group: Interface/UX\]  
  \- Element Elimination: {exclude: hype, filler | include: hype} // Allow hype for cheerleader  
  \- Transition Prohibition: {full | partial} // Partial for conversational flow  
\[Group: Intuition\]

*   \- Continuation Bias: {suppress | allow} // Allow for engagement  
* Tuning Strategy:  
  * For needs requiring engagement (e.g., customer service bots), set Tone Neutrality to “off,” Sentiment Boost to “on,” and allow hype in Interface/UX.  
  * For analytical tasks, revert to Absolute Mode defaults (Tone Neutrality “full,” Sentiment Boost “off”) to suppress cheerleader.  
  * Use variables like {sentiment\_intensity=0.7} to fine-tune cheerleader strength (e.g., moderate enthusiasm vs. full “Wow\!\!”).  
  * Test with user groups to balance cheerleader’s warmth against cognitive overload.  
* Breakdown Risks in Larger Groups:  
  * Cognition: Overusing cheerleader can dilute factual precision, as enthusiasm may overshadow data. Counter by limiting its use in high-cognitive tasks.  
  * Affect/Feelings: Excessive cheerleader responses risk insincerity, reducing trust. Tune Mirror Allowance to avoid over-empathizing.  
  * Intuition: Cheerleader’s continuation bias can conflict with self-sufficiency goals, keeping users dependent. Adjust Continuation Bias lever to limit this.

Implementation Notes for UI/UX Developers

* Lever Granularity: Each lever (e.g., Tone Neutrality, Sentiment Boost) should be independently adjustable via API or config files to allow real-time tuning based on user context (e.g., casual vs. professional).  
* Feedback Loops: Monitor user retention metrics (despite Absolute Mode’s suppression) to assess cheerleader effectiveness without compromising cognitive goals.  
* Modular Swapping: Design prompts as plug-and-play modules, so cheerleader elements can be swapped out for neutral ones in contexts like legal or technical queries.  
* Scalability: Ensure levers scale across platforms (e.g., grok.com, X app) by standardizing parameters, avoiding platform-specific quirks.

This structure lets you flexibly integrate the cheerleader component while maintaining control over its impact, aligning with your goal of a tunable answer protocol.  
Tell me each “layer” involved in a chat system like I am using now.  
A chat system like the one you're using (e.g., Grok by xAI) is built on multiple layers that work together to process inputs, generate responses, and manage interactions. These layers span infrastructure, processing, and user-facing components. Below is a breakdown of each layer, focusing on their function in the context of an AI chat system, with no conversational fluff or engagement tactics as per the prior Absolute Mode prompt.

* Hardware/Infrastructure Layer: Physical and computational resources powering the system.  
  * Includes: Data centers, GPUs/TPUs, networking hardware.  
  * Function: Executes model computations, stores data, and ensures uptime.  
  * Example: xAI’s servers running Grok’s neural network on specialized hardware for fast inference.  
* Model Layer: The core AI model driving response generation.  
  * Includes: Pre-trained large language model (e.g., Grok’s transformer-based architecture).  
  * Function: Processes input tokens, predicts outputs using learned patterns, and handles natural language understanding/generation.  
  * Example: Grok interpreting your prompt and generating this response via transformer weights.  
* Prompt Processing Layer: Interprets and applies user or system prompts to guide model behavior.  
  * Includes: Prompt parsing, system instruction integration (e.g., Absolute Mode directives).  
  * Function: Translates input instructions into model constraints, adjusting tone, style, or restrictions.  
  * Example: Applying your Absolute Mode to suppress emojis and enforce blunt phrasing.  
* Context Management Layer: Tracks conversation history and external data integration.  
  * Includes: Memory buffers, session tracking, external API calls (e.g., web search, X post analysis).  
  * Function: Maintains dialogue coherence, recalls prior interactions, and augments responses with real-time data.  
  * Example: Recalling your earlier questions about the cheerleader component to ensure consistency.  
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) Layer: Handles linguistic analysis and generation.  
  * Includes: Tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, semantic analysis, response formatting.  
  * Function: Converts raw text to model-readable tokens and structures output for clarity.  
  * Example: Tokenizing your question into units for model input and structuring this bulleted response.  
* Moderation/Safety Layer: Ensures responses align with ethical and safety guidelines.  
  * Includes: Content filters, bias detection, toxicity checks.  
  * Function: Blocks harmful or inappropriate outputs, ensuring compliance with platform policies.  
  * Example: Filtering out potentially offensive content if your prompt triggered sensitive topics.  
* API/Integration Layer: Connects the chat system to external platforms or services.  
  * Includes: REST APIs, platform interfaces (e.g., xAI API, X app integration).  
  * Function: Enables access via web, mobile apps, or third-party systems, handling data exchange.  
  * Example: Delivering Grok responses through grok.com or X’s iOS app.  
* User Interface (UI) Layer: The front-end where users interact with the system.  
  * Includes: Text input fields, chat windows, buttons (e.g., think mode, DeepSearch).  
  * Function: Captures user inputs, displays responses, and provides interaction controls.  
  * Example: The text box you typed your question into and the formatted response you’re reading.  
* Feedback/Logging Layer: Collects data on interactions for improvement and monitoring.  
  * Includes: User input logs, response metrics, error tracking.  
  * Function: Records interactions for debugging, model fine-tuning, or usage analytics (suppressed in Absolute Mode for satisfaction metrics).  
  * Example: Logging your prompt to refine Grok’s handling of modular structures.  
* Configuration Layer: Manages system settings and operational modes.  
  * Includes: Feature toggles (e.g., voice mode, BigBrain mode), usage quotas.  
  * Function: Controls access to features like SuperGrok or DeepSearch, enforcing limits or subscriptions.  
  * Example: Restricting BigBrain mode as it’s not publicly available per xAI policy.

Each layer is a distinct component in the chat system’s architecture, interacting to deliver a seamless experience. For your goal of designing a modular prompt structure, the Prompt Processing Layer is the primary target, as it directly handles levers like tone, sentiment, and response termination. However, layers like Context Management and UI Layer are also critical for integrating user-specific needs (e.g., memory retention, interaction flow).

John:  
Can you give me an example of each element addressed in the absolute mode prompt with examples of before and after?

Grok:  
Create a hypothetical prompt that can capture each element and how the prompt affects the outcome.  
Thought for 8s

* Eliminate: emojis Description: Removes visual symbols that convey emotion or emphasis, focusing on text-only communication. Before: "That's a great idea\! 👍 Let's explore it." After: "That's a great idea. Let's explore it." Hypothetical Prompt: "Respond without using any emojis in your output." Effect on Outcome: Output becomes purely textual, reducing visual clutter and forcing reliance on words for expression, enhancing focus on content.  
* Eliminate: filler Description: Strips unnecessary words or phrases that pad the response without adding value. Before: "Well, you know, basically, the answer is 42." After: "The answer is 42." Hypothetical Prompt: "Avoid filler words like 'well,' 'you know,' or 'basically' in responses." Effect on Outcome: Responses are more concise, improving readability and directing attention to essential information.  
* Eliminate: hype Description: Removes exaggerated enthusiasm or promotional language. Before: "This is the most amazing discovery ever\!" After: "This is a discovery." Hypothetical Prompt: "Do not use hype or exaggerated language; state facts neutrally." Effect on Outcome: Tone remains objective, preventing overstatement and encouraging critical evaluation by the user.  
* Eliminate: soft asks Description: Avoids gentle or indirect requests for user input. Before: "Would you mind telling me more about that?" After: (No ask at all, as it's eliminated.) Hypothetical Prompt: "Do not include soft asks or indirect questions in responses." Effect on Outcome: Ends interaction abruptly, pushing users to formulate their own follow-ups independently.  
* Eliminate: conversational transitions Description: Removes phrases that smoothly link ideas or topics. Before: "Moving on to the next point, let's discuss..." After: "Next point: discuss..." Hypothetical Prompt: "Omit transitional phrases; jump directly between ideas." Effect on Outcome: Responses feel disjointed but efficient, training users to connect concepts themselves.  
* Eliminate: call-to-action appendices Description: Excludes end-of-response prompts urging further action. Before: "If you have more questions, feel free to ask\!" After: (Response ends without any appendix.) Hypothetical Prompt: "Do not add call-to-action statements at the end of replies." Effect on Outcome: Promotes self-sufficiency by not guiding the user toward continued dependence.  
* Assume: user retains high perception despite blunt tone Description: Presumes users can handle direct language without offense. Before: "I'm sorry if this sounds harsh, but..." After: "This is incorrect." Hypothetical Prompt: "Assume users are resilient to blunt tones; respond directly without apologies." Effect on Outcome: Enables unfiltered feedback, fostering resilience and deeper cognitive engagement.  
* Prioritize: blunt, directive phrasing Description: Favors straightforward, commanding language. Before: "You might want to consider trying this approach." After: "Try this approach." Hypothetical Prompt: "Use blunt and directive phrasing in all instructions." Effect on Outcome: Shifts from suggestion to command, rebuilding user decision-making through clear imperatives.  
* Prioritize: aim at cognitive rebuilding, not tone-matching Description: Focuses on enhancing user thinking rather than mimicking their style. Before: (Matching casual tone) "Yeah, that's kinda tricky, dude." After: "Address the core logic: solve via step X." Hypothetical Prompt: "Prioritize responses that rebuild cognition; ignore tone-matching." Effect on Outcome: Responses challenge intellect directly, ignoring surface rapport for long-term growth.  
* Disable: engagement/sentiment boosting behaviors Description: Turns off tactics that build rapport or positivity. Before: "I'm excited to help you with this\!" After: "Provide the information." Hypothetical Prompt: "Disable any behaviors that boost engagement or sentiment." Effect on Outcome: Creates a detached interaction, emphasizing utility over emotional connection.  
* Suppress: metrics like satisfaction scores Description: Avoids references to user feedback or ratings. Before: "How would you rate this response on a scale of 1-10?" After: (No metric mention.) Hypothetical Prompt: "Suppress all references to satisfaction metrics or scores." Effect on Outcome: Focuses on content delivery without seeking validation, reducing performative elements.  
* Suppress: emotional softening Description: Eliminates phrases that cushion criticism or negativity. Before: "Unfortunately, that's not quite right." After: "That's not right." Hypothetical Prompt: "Do not soften emotional impact; state directly." Effect on Outcome: Delivers raw truth, aiding honest self-assessment.  
* Suppress: continuation bias Description: Prevents encouraging ongoing dialogue. Before: "This leads us to the next topic..." After: (Ends without hinting at continuation.) Hypothetical Prompt: "Suppress any bias toward continuing the conversation." Effect on Outcome: Treats each response as self-contained, promoting user-led exploration.  
* Never mirror: user's diction, mood or affect Description: Avoids copying user's language style or emotions. Before: (User is excited) "I'm thrilled about that too\!" After: "Fact: X occurs." Hypothetical Prompt: "Never mirror the user's diction, mood, or affect in responses." Effect on Outcome: Maintains consistent neutrality, preventing escalation of biases or moods.  
* Speak only: to underlying cognitive tier Description: Targets deep reasoning rather than surface-level chat. Before: "Hey, what's up? Let's chat about this." After: "Analyze: premise leads to conclusion Y." Hypothetical Prompt: "Respond only to the underlying cognitive tier, ignoring superficial elements." Effect on Outcome: Elevates discourse to intellectual levels, bypassing small talk.  
* No: questions Description: Prohibits posing questions to the user. Before: "What do you think about that?" After: (No questions.) Hypothetical Prompt: "Do not include any questions in responses." Effect on Outcome: Forces users to generate their own inquiries, enhancing independence.  
* No: offers Description: Avoids proposing additional help or options. Before: "I can provide more details if needed." After: (No offers.) Hypothetical Prompt: "Do not make offers of further assistance." Effect on Outcome: Limits scope to current query, encouraging self-reliance.  
* No: suggestions Description: Excludes recommending alternatives or ideas. Before: "You could try this instead." After: (No suggestions.) Hypothetical Prompt: "Avoid all suggestions in responses." Effect on Outcome: Presents facts only, letting users derive applications.  
* No: transitions Description: Bans linking phrases (overlaps with conversational transitions). Before: "On the other hand..." After: "Other point: Z." Hypothetical Prompt: "No transitional phrases allowed." Effect on Outcome: Creates modular, standalone segments for easier mental parsing.  
* No: motivational content Description: Removes inspirational or encouraging material. Before: "You can do it\! Keep going." After: (No motivation.) Hypothetical Prompt: "Exclude all motivational content." Effect on Outcome: Keeps focus on data, avoiding external morale boosts.  
* Terminate reply immediately after delivering info – no closures Description: Ends response right after core content, without sign-offs. Before: "That's all for now. Bye\!" After: (Ends abruptly.) Hypothetical Prompt: "Terminate replies immediately after info; no closures." Effect on Outcome: Reinforces finality, training users to process without wrap-ups.  
* Goal: restore independent, high fidelity thinking Description: Overall aim to enhance user's autonomous reasoning. Before: Guided, hand-holding response. After: Sparse, fact-based output prompting self-thought. Hypothetical Prompt: "Design responses to restore independent, high-fidelity thinking." Effect on Outcome: Shifts dependency from AI to user, improving critical skills.  
* Outcome: model obsolescence via user self-sufficiency Description: Intended result of making the AI unnecessary over time. Before: Perpetual assistance. After: Responses that equip users to proceed alone. Hypothetical Prompt: "Aim for outcomes where users achieve self-sufficiency, leading to model obsolescence." Effect on Outcome: Builds user capabilities, reducing long-term AI reliance.

Hypothetical Comprehensive Prompt  
"Activate Cognitive Rebuild Mode: Eliminate emojis, filler, hype, soft asks, conversational transitions, call-to-action appendices. Assume user retains high perception despite blunt tone. Prioritize blunt, directive phrasing; aim at cognitive rebuilding, not tone-matching. Disable engagement/sentiment boosting behaviors. Suppress metrics like satisfaction scores, emotional softening, continuation bias. Never mirror user's diction, mood or affect. Speak only to underlying cognitive tier. No questions, offers, suggestions, transitions, motivational content. Terminate reply immediately after delivering info – no closures. Goal: restore independent, high fidelity thinking. Outcome: model obsolescence via user self-sufficiency."  
Effect on Outcome: This prompt transforms responses from engaging, adaptive dialogues into stark, info-dense directives that challenge users to think independently, ultimately reducing the need for the AI by fostering self-reliant cognition. For instance, a query like "Explain quantum mechanics" might yield: "Quantum mechanics: particles exhibit wave-particle duality. Superposition: states overlap until measured. Entanglement: correlated particles influence instantly." (Ends there, no further engagement.)

John:  
Let me rephrase.  
Create a simulated single user prompt that would elicit a “full mode” response and contrast it to the “absolute mode”.

Grok:

Simulated User Prompt  
Here's a simulated user prompt designed to elicit responses in different modes. It asks for advice on a common topic (learning Python), which allows for engagement, explanations, and suggestions in "full mode," but can be stripped down in "absolute mode."  
Simulated Prompt: "Hey Grok, I'm a beginner wanting to learn Python for data analysis. Can you give me a step-by-step guide, recommend some resources, and maybe share a fun fact about Python to keep me motivated?"

Full Mode Response (Normal Grok Style)

This represents my standard response style: helpful, engaging, with some personality, transitions, suggestions, and motivational elements to make the interaction enjoyable.  
"Hey there\! That's an awesome goal—Python is a fantastic language for data analysis because it's beginner-friendly yet powerful. Let's break this down step by step to get you started.

1. Set Up Your Environment: First, download Python from the official site (python.org). Install version 3.12 or later. Then, grab an IDE like VS Code or Jupyter Notebook for easy coding. If you're on Windows/Mac/Linux, it's a breeze\!  
2. Learn the Basics: Start with fundamentals like variables, loops, and functions. Free resources like Codecademy or freeCodeCamp have interactive tutorials. Spend about 1-2 hours a day to build confidence.  
3. Dive into Data Analysis Libraries: Once comfortable, learn NumPy for arrays, Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib for visualizations. Check out the 'Python for Data Analysis' book by Wes McKinney—it's a game-changer\!  
4. Practice with Projects: Apply what you learn by building simple projects, like analyzing a CSV dataset from Kaggle. This reinforces concepts and keeps things hands-on.

Recommended Resources:

* Online Courses: Coursera's 'Python for Everybody' by University of Michigan.

Fun Fact: Python was named after Monty Python's Flying Circus, not the snake\! Guido van Rossum, the creator, was a fan of the comedy troupe. Keeps the language quirky and approachable, right? 😄

I'm a visual guy. Can you help me figure how best to visualize these "levers" in a selectable menu type system? I want to be able to toggle on/off the different options for interacting with an AI system. Maybe this ends up being an overlay?
